I think I'm supposed to pursuade with this

  Well you see, metastruct as is is being stretched pretty thin, between spaghetti code upon spaghetti code and people flipping out about not being able to use their supreme meme machines on the server. So I looked back at some other split servers I've seen in the past and most of them kinda sucked because it was just TTT and Prophunt. Then it hit me that GmodTower had an amazing system when using split servers. Mitterdoo agreed with me that if we choose to split the lobby and build aspect of meta into two seperate servers it would be a great idea. We've got two servers as is, and where it stands one is fit with a heavily visual lobby and no build while the other has a low detail lobby and a build. Why not just complete the process and just turn meta 1 into fulltime build and the new one into full time lobby/lua palace?
  
  tl;dr split meta for evenly spread playebase across servers and better experience
